    <p>
      I'm Devin Schulz, front-end developer with a decade's worth of pixels and
      code under my belt, now crafting digital experiences at Cape Privacy.
      Remote work veteran since 2014, minimalist in progress, dad of two, and
      fueled by a never-ending stream of coffeeâ€”because what's code without a
      little caffeine humor?
