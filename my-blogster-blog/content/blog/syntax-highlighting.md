Syntax highlighting is done using [Prism.js](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism) with the default [nord theme](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes/blob/master/themes/prism-nord.css). You can customise to whichever theme you want from the [plenty available prism themes](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes).

## HTML Code Block

An example `HTML` code block.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Example HTML5 Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Test</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

## JSX Code Block

An example `jsx` code block.

```jsx
const Greet = () => {
  const message = `Hello World!`;
  return <div>{message}</div>;
};
```

## CSS Code Block

An example `css` code block.

```css
.layout {
  display: grid;
