Hello! I’m Devin Schulz, and for the past 10 years, I’ve been deeply immersed in
the world of web development and product design. While I consider myself a
full-stack developer, my true calling is front-end development where I bring
digital products to life with meticulous attention to detail and functionality.

I’m based in Ottawa, Canada, but my work knows no boundaries. Whether you're
local or halfway across the world, I bring the same level of commitment and
expertise to the table. My work ethic is defined by a detail-oriented and
perfectionist streak that never compromises my ability to deliver. I thrive in
collaborative settings where I can mentor others and make informed decisions
that define a product’s architecture.

I'm passionate about creating accessible designs and interfaces, ensuring that
the products I develop are not only intuitive but accessible to everyone.
Performance is another obsession of mine—I believe that the best designs not
only look good but also work seamlessly.

Over the years, I've had the privilege of collaborating with notable companies
such as Shopify, Cape Privacy, InVision, The Ottawa Hospital, Algonquin College,
CHEO, York University, Paystone, and REALTOR.ca. These experiences have not only
honed my skills but also reinforced my belief in the power of digital solutions
to transform and empower businesses and organizations.
