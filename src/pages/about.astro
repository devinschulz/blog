      <p>
        I’m a front-end developer with over 10 years of experience building
        fast, accessible, and thoughtfully designed web and mobile apps. While I
        work across the stack, I’m most at home on the front end—where design,
        usability, and performance come together.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m based in Ottawa, Canada, but I’ve worked with teams across North
        America. I care deeply about the details, and I’m just as comfortable
        mentoring others as I am shipping production code. I enjoy making smart,
        pragmatic decisions that shape products from the ground up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accessibility and performance are core to how I work. I believe great
        interfaces should be intuitive, inclusive, and fast by default.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve worked with companies like Shopify, Cape, InVision, The Ottawa
        Hospital, Algonquin College, CHEO, York University, Paystone, and
        REALTOR.ca—solving real problems and helping teams move fast without
        cutting corners.

            I design clean, intuitive interfaces that put the user first. Every
            element serves a purpose, and the goal is always the same: make it
            simple, usable, and enjoyable.

            I turn designs into fast, accessible, and responsive apps. My code
            is clean, scalable, and built with care—front to back.

            Consultation
          </h3>
          <p class="lg:my-0">
            I review codebases, spot issues, and offer practical ways to improve
            performance, maintainability, and structure. Whether it’s cleaning
            up legacy code or planning for scale, I help teams move forward with
            confidence.
